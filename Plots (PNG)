# I'm sorry for not actualy uploading the files.
# I had a few problems uploading files to GitHub.
# The "solution" I found was to upload the images in a website designed to upload imgaes on the internet.
# The name of the website is postimg.org and I provide the links below:
# 
# http://postimg.org/image/jl4na2gmj/  #Plot1
# http://postimg.org/image/3o5vdco8b/  #Plot2
# http://postimg.org/image/rt6kv28iz/  #Plot3
# http://postimg.org/image/m6a7xl60b/  #Plot4
#
# You may check the code in R is correct and it will plot excactly the same content as the images in the links I provided.
# Nevertheles I'm fully aware that it's fair for me to be penalized "gradewise".
# Thank you for reading this.
